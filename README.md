### Source Code

```
I was inspired to write this program out of my frustration with other programs that transfer files using Winsock. Knowing that the FTP protocal is faster, I decided to use it. Originally I was going to make it able to use the mFTP protocal so that it could download the same file from many sites at the same time thereby increasing the download speed. It was very difficult, so when Jared asked me to write an FTP module for his program, MasterX Console, I was delighted.
FTP.h is a wonderful class full of fun filled FTP calls. It's really great for other uses as well, like program updates, game map downloads, etc.
